# AirBnB_Messina
The story behind the project
Welcome to my new project
When I worked as an engineer in 2015, I wanted to become an entrepreneur. As a result of my thinking, I started three businesses. One of them was an Airbnb.
But because of several reasons(easter bombing Sri Lanka and Covid ) sadly I decided to shut down my AirBnB located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Once I came to Italy in 2021, I had a dream idea to start a  BnB in Messina.
Finally today I am able to do an analysis of my business idea with what I have learned in the Data industry.

Where to find the Data Set

Questions to answer

Is this business idea profitable?
Are there any correlations between revenue and prices?
Any particular location to establish the business?
What kind of property type is best?
